##Maps

The Map interface is part of the Collections Framework even though it's not a true collection, in the true sense of the term.

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/index.html

The Map interface replaces the obsolete dictionaries abstract class and like the class it replaces, it maps keys to values.

A language dictionary is a classic example of a Map, with the keys being the words in the dictionaries,
and the values being the definitions.

A java Map cannot:

 - contain duplicate keys
 - each key can only map to a single value
 
 The two most famous classes that implements Map are Hash and Linked Hash.
 
 Tree Map instead implements the sorted map interface.
 
 Maps, like all the core collection interfaces, are generic, which means they take two types,
 one for the key, one for the value.
 It is possible to use raw maps, where the types are not specified, but this is never a good idea.
