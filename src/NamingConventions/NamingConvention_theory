# Naming conventions:

**Naming conventions** are useful to make your code easier to read for other people and yourself.

_Things you can name in Java are:_

 -  Packages
 -  Classes
 - Interfaces
 - Methods
 - Constants
 -  Variables
 - Type parameters

_**Packages**_

 - Always lower case
 - Packages name should be unique
 - Use your internet domain name, reversed, as a prefix for the package name.
 - Oracle specify a convention for package names at:
 https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se10/html/index.html

_**Class names**_

- CamelCase
- CLass names should be nouns (they represent things)
- Should start with a capital letter
- Each word in the name should also start with a capital (e.g. LinkedList)

_**Interface names**_

- Capitalized like class names (CamelCase)
- Consider what objects implementing the interface will become of what they will be able to do:

          Examples
            * List
            * Comparable
            * Serializeable

_**Method names**_

- mixedCase
- Often verbs
- Reflect the function performed or the results returned

            Examples
            * size()
            * getName()
            * addPlayer()

 _**Constants**_

  - ALWAYS UPPER CASE
  - Separate words with underscore _
  - Declare using the final keyword

            Examples:
            * Final final int MAX_INT
            * Final final short SEVERITY_ERROR
            * Final final double P1 = 3.141592653

 _**Variable names**_

 - mixedCase
 - Meaningful and indicative
 - Start with lower case letter
 - Do not use underscores _

            Examples:
            * i
            * league
            * sidneySwans
            * boxLentgh

 _**Type parameters**_

 - Single Character, capital letters
 - Guidelines given at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/TOC.html

            Examples:
            * E - Element (used extensively by the Java Collections Framework)
            * K - Key
            * T - Type
            * V - Value
            * S,U,V, etc. - 2nd, 3rd, 4th types
