Encapsulation (definition) ->
Encapsulation is the mechanism that allows you to restrict access to certain component of the object you are creating.
It's a way to protect the member of a class blocking unauthorized access to them.
This is not a concept that concerns security, although it seems so.
Encapsulation is a way of hiding the inner working of a class from another class, thus allowing you to have more control over that class,
and also allowing you to change code more easily without breaking any major mechanism.

Potential risks ->
A). By opening the access to your fields directly, you are exposing your application to be potentially accessed in way you don't want to
or you didn't account for in your code, causing all sort of issues.
B). Changing a name, for example a field name into your non-encapsulated class will reflect to the other classes using that field name.
