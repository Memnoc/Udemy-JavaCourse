Abstraction is defining the required functionality for something, without actually implementing the details.
In other words, is focusing on what needs to be done, but now it can be done.
Interfaces, for example, are purely abstract. The implementation does not happen in the interface itself, rather
happens in the class that implements the interface (hence, the word "implementation");

Java allows defining abstract classes. These are classes that define methods but do not provide any implementation of those methods.
The implementation is left to the class that inherits from the abstract class.

You cannot directyl instantiate a class that is abstracted in any way.
