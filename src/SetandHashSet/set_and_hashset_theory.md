## Set

 - It has no defined ordering (chaotic)
 - Cannot contain duplicates
 - Basic methods of this interface are: **add(); remove(); clear(); size(); and isEmpty();**
 - You can check a specific item in the set using a contains(); method
 - There is no way to retrieve an item from a set: you can check if something exists, and you can iterate through the elements in the set
 but attempting to retrieve a specific element in the set is not possible.
 
 - A Set can also be used as key in a Map. The keys in a Map are Sets, and can be retrieved using the keySet(); method.
 
 - just like keys in a Map, using an immutable objects as elements in a set can cause problems, and the behaviour is undefined
 if changing an object affects equal comparisons just as a map.
 
  - A Set cannot be an element of itself.
  
  - The best performance implementation of a Set is the HashSet.
  
  ## HashSet
  
 This class uses hashes to store the items.
 
  - It is practically the same as an HashMap class
  - A set can be implemented using a Map.
  - You can use the corresponding Map object and use only the keys ignoring the values so this.
  This is pretty much what HashSet does, and whenever an element is added to the set it becomes a key in the underlying HashMap,
  and a dummy object is stored as the value.
  - Sets can be useful because operations on them are very fast.
