## Set and HashSet challenge:

_Description_:

When overriding the equals() method in the HeavenlyBody class, we
were careful to make sure that it would not return true if a HeavenlyBody was compared to a subclass of itself.
     
We did that to demonstrate that method, but it was actually
unnecessary in the HeavenlyBody class.
     
The mini challenge is just a question: why was it unnecessary?

Answer:
     
(My answer)
It was unnecessary because the class HeavenlyBody was declared final, so it cannot be extended and used by any class.

(Official answer)
The HeavenlyBody class is declared final, so cannot be subclassed.
The Java String class is also final, which is why it can safely
use the instance of method without having to worry about
comparisons with a subclass.
