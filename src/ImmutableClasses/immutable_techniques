## Immutable Classes

 - Are classes that cannot be changed
 - Why to have an immutable class? It's a great way to increase encapsulation and limit changes to the code from external developers.
 
 **Useful Techniques**
 
  - Use getters instead of exposing the object directly from the constructor
  - Make fields private and final
  - Do not provide setters (if not strictly needed)
