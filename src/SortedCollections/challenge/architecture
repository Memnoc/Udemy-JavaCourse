This is an application that will allow a customer to choose form a list of item, and put those items in a basket.

To do this, I will prepare to Collections:

A - A list of the available items (as in, available in stock)

B - A list of customer has added to the basket

The first piece of the architecture is the Stock Item class.
In this class I will:

 - store the name, the price and the stock quantity of the items to sell
 - I will override equals and hashcode
 - I will implement comparable so that the item can be used in a sorted collection
 
 StockList class:
 
  - is gonna hold a list of all the stock items in a Map
  - I will add a method to add stock, remove it
 
 Important consideration: because the StockItem class uses a String name to check equality,
 we can use that as as key for the map in this class
