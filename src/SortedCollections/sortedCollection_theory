#### Sorted Collections

The link variants of hash and set are called linked hash map and linked hash set.
The particular thing about these two collections is that they have an order.

The regular ordering of items in a HashSet or HashMap is defined as "chaotic" so the items are ordered randomly.
The linked version of this two collections uses a LinkedList to order the elements,
which means that the iterator returns the elements in the order they have been inserted.
