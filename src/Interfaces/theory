An interface, in Java terms, specifies a method a particular class implementing the interface MUST implement.
The interface as it is it's defined as "abstract", which means there is no code to the method defined in the interface. The class -
implementing the interface must provide the code for those methods.
The idea behind an interface is providing a common behaviour that can be used by several classes by having them all implementing the same interface.
In other words, it's a way o standardize the way a group of classes behaves.
